## Why Compliance Matters for AI

When using AI services like OpenAI, Anthropic, or other LLM providers, you're sending user data to third-party systems. This creates significant **legal and compliance risks** under modern privacy regulations.

**Blindfold protects you** by ensuring sensitive data never reaches AI providers in plain text. PII is detected and anonymized _before_ it leaves your infrastructure.

```
User message                    Blindfold                        AI Provider
"Email hans@example.de"  →  "Email <Email Address_1>"  →  AI only sees tokens
                                                              ↓
"I'll email hans@..."    ←   Detokenize with mapping   ←  "I'll email <Email Address_1>"
```

## Why Blindfold Matters

When using AI services like OpenAI, Anthropic, or other LLM providers, you're often sending user data to third-party systems. This creates significant **legal and compliance risks** under modern privacy regulations.

**Blindfold protects you** by ensuring sensitive data never reaches AI providers in plain text.

## EU AI Act

The **EU AI Act** (effective 2024-2026) is the world's first comprehensive AI regulation. It requires organizations to:

### Key Requirements

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Data Minimization" icon="compress">
    **Requirement**: Only collect and process the minimum data necessary.

    **Risk**: Sending full user conversations to AI providers violates this principle.

    **Blindfold Solution**: Tokenize or redact PII before sending to AI, keeping only necessary context.

    ```python
    # Compliant approach
    protected = client.tokenize(user_message)
    ai_response = openai.chat(protected.text)  # No PII sent
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Third-Party Data Sharing" icon="share-nodes">
    **Requirement**: Strict controls on sharing personal data with third parties.

    **Risk**: Every AI API call shares user data with the provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.).

    **Blindfold Solution**: AI providers never see real PII, only anonymized versions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Transparency & Documentation" icon="file-lines">
    **Requirement**: Document all data processing activities.

    **Risk**: Must prove data protection measures are in place.

    **Blindfold Solution**: Audit logs show exactly what PII was detected and protected.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="High-Risk AI Systems" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    **Requirement**: Extra controls for AI systems that process sensitive data.

    **Risk**: Healthcare, finance, and HR AI applications face stricter rules.

    **Blindfold Solution**: Automatic PII detection and removal meets high-risk requirements.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## GDPR Compliance

The **General Data Protection Regulation** (GDPR) applies to all EU residents' data, regardless of where your company is located.

### Critical GDPR Requirements

| Requirement | Without Blindfold | With Blindfold |
|-------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Data Minimization** | Full user data sent to AI | Only anonymized data sent |
| **Purpose Limitation** | AI provider logs everything | PII never reaches provider |
| **Right to be Forgotten** | Data in AI provider logs | Use redaction for permanent removal |
| **Data Processing Agreement** | Complex agreements needed | Simplified - no PII shared |
| **Data Breach Notification** | Must notify if AI provider breached | Lower risk - no real PII exposed |

### Right to be Forgotten

GDPR requires you to delete user data on request:

```python
# Redact user data permanently
user_data = fetch_user_records(user_id)
for record in user_data:
    redacted = client.redact(record.content)
    update_record(record.id, redacted.text)

# PII permanently removed, compliant with GDPR
```

## HIPAA Compliance (Healthcare)

The **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act** (HIPAA) protects medical information in the United States.

### HIPAA Requirements

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Encryption at Rest" icon="lock">
    Protected Health Information (PHI) must be encrypted when stored.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Encryption in Transit" icon="shield">
    PHI must be encrypted during transmission.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Access Controls" icon="user-lock">
    Strict controls on who can access PHI.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Audit Logs" icon="list-check">
    Track all access to PHI.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### How Blindfold Helps

```python
# Encrypt medical records
patient_record = "Patient John Doe, SSN: 123-45-6789, Diagnosis: diabetes"

encrypted = client.encrypt(
    patient_record,
    encryption_key=HIPAA_ENCRYPTION_KEY
)

# Store encrypted - HIPAA compliant
secure_db.save(encrypted.text)
```

**Key Benefits:**
- AES-256 encryption meets HIPAA standards
- Automatic PHI detection (names, SSNs, medical IDs)
- Audit logs for compliance reporting
- Secure key management

## PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry)

If you handle credit card data, **PCI-DSS** compliance is mandatory.

### Requirements

- Protect cardholder data
- Mask card numbers when displayed
- Encrypt card data in storage
- Log all access to card data

### Blindfold for PCI-DSS

```python
# Mask credit cards for display (PCI-DSS compliant)
display_text = client.mask(
    "Card: 4532-7562-9102-3456",
    chars_to_show=4,
    from_end=True
)
# Output: "Card: ***************3456"

# Encrypt for storage
encrypted = client.encrypt(
    card_data,
    encryption_key=PCI_KEY
)
```

    2. **If Blindfold is breached**: We notify you within 72 hours per GDPR
    3. **Reduced risk**: Tokenized/hashed data is not useful to attackers
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I prove compliance to auditors?" icon="clipboard-check">
    Blindfold provides:

    1. **Audit logs**: Shows all PII detection and anonymization
    2. **API documentation**: Proof of data protection implementation

## Best Practices

### 1. Use the Right Method for Your Use Case

```python
# For AI processing (reversible)
client.tokenize(text)

# For permanent removal (GDPR Right to be Forgotten)
client.redact(text)

# For storage (encrypted)
client.encrypt(text, encryption_key=KEY)

# For analytics (non-reversible tracking)
client.hash(text)
```

### 2. Document Your Data Flows

Create documentation showing:
- Where PII enters your system
- How it's protected (tokenization, encryption, etc.)
- Where it's sent (AI providers only see anonymized data)
- How long it's retained
- How it's deleted (right to be forgotten)

### 3. Regular Compliance Reviews

- **Monthly**: Review audit logs for unusual patterns
- **Quarterly**: Test PII detection accuracy
- **Annually**: Update privacy policies and DPAs
- **When regulations change**: Adjust protection methods

### 4. Staff Training

Ensure your team understands:
- Why PII protection is critical
- How to use Blindfold correctly
- When to use each protection method
- How to respond to data subject requests

## What is Blindfold?

Blindfold is a privacy-first infrastructure API that helps you securely protect sensitive data (PII) before sending it to AI models and third-party services. It provides automated detection and protection of over 50 types of personally identifiable information.

### The Problem

When building AI applications, you often need to send user data to large language models (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.). However, this data may contain sensitive information like:

- Personal names and emails
- Phone numbers and addresses
- Credit card numbers and SSNs
- Medical records and IDs
- IP addresses and URLs

Sending this data directly to third-party AI providers can create compliance risks (GDPR, HIPAA, EU AI Act) and privacy concerns.

### The Solution

Blindfold sits between your application and AI services, automatically detecting and protecting sensitive data:

1. **Send us your text** with sensitive information
2. **We return protected text** (tokenized/masked/redacted)
3. **You send safe text to AI models** without privacy risks
4. **We restore original data** (if needed) after getting the AI response

## Key Features

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Tokenization" icon="shuffle">
    Replace sensitive data with reversible tokens like `<PERSON_1>`. Perfect for AI interactions where you need to restore original values.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Masking" icon="eye-slash">
    Partially hide data (e.g., `****-****-****-1234`). Useful for displaying data while maintaining privacy.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Redaction" icon="eraser">
    Permanently remove sensitive information. Ideal for complete data removal without the ability to restore.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Synthesis" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
    Replace real data with realistic fake data using Faker. Great for testing and demos.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Hashing" icon="hashtag">
    Convert data to deterministic hashes. Useful for analytics and matching without exposing original values.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Encryption" icon="lock">
    Encrypt data using AES encryption. Reversible with proper encryption key.

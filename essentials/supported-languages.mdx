Blindfold's AI-powered detection engine supports PII detection across multiple languages with varying levels of performance.

## Native Language Support (Highest Accuracy)

These languages have been specifically trained for PII detection and provide the best accuracy:

## Zero-Shot Language Support (High Accuracy)

These languages work through our multilingual detection engine without specific training, achieving excellent results:

## Experimental Support

These languages are supported but may require additional validation for production use:

- **Chinese** - Supported, but PII patterns differ significantly
- **Japanese** - Supported, but PII patterns differ significantly
- **Arabic** - Supported with testing recommended

## Automatic Language Detection

The detection engine automatically identifies the language - no configuration needed.

```python
# Mix multiple languages in one request
response = client.tokenize(
    "Contact: John Doe, Email: john@example.com, Teléfono: +34 912 345 678"
)
# Automatically detects entities in both English and Spanish
```

```javascript
// Works seamlessly across languages
const response = await client.tokenize(
  "Nome: Paolo Rossi, E-Mail: paolo@esempio.it, Osoba: Jan Novák"
);
// Detects Italian and Czech automatically
```

<Tip>
  For best results, use one of the **Native Language Support** languages. Zero-shot languages work well but may have slightly lower confidence scores for complex entity types.
</Tip>

## Language-Specific Examples

### European Mix
```python
text = """
Cliente: María García (España)
Email: maria@ejemplo.es
Kunde: Hans Müller (Deutschland)
E-Mail: hans@beispiel.de
Client: Jean Dupont (France)
Courriel: jean@exemple.fr
"""

response = client.tokenize(text, policy="gdpr_eu")
# Detects PII across Spanish, German, and French
```

### Slavic Languages
```python
text = """
Osoba: Jan Novák (Česko)
E-mail: jan@priklad.cz
Osoba: Piotr Kowalski (Polska)
E-mail: piotr@przyklad.pl
"""

response = client.tokenize(text, policy="gdpr_eu")
# Works with Czech and Polish
```

title: "HIPAA Compliance"
description: "Protect PHI in healthcare AI applications with US data residency"
---

The **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act** (HIPAA) protects medical information in the United States. Any AI application that processes Protected Health Information (PHI) must comply with HIPAA's Privacy and Security Rules.

Blindfold helps by **tokenizing PHI in the US region** before it reaches any AI provider. The LLM only sees anonymized tokens — never real patient names, SSNs, or medical records.

## Who Must Comply

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Covered Entities" icon="hospital">
    Healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses that transmit health information electronically.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Business Associates" icon="handshake">
    Any organization that creates, receives, maintains, or transmits PHI on behalf of a covered entity — including AI/software vendors.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

If your AI application processes patient data for a healthcare organization, HIPAA likely applies to you.

## The 18 HIPAA Identifiers

HIPAA's Safe Harbor method (45 CFR § 164.514(b)(2)) requires removal of 18 types of identifiers for de-identification. Blindfold's `hipaa_us` policy covers them:

| # | Identifier | Blindfold Entity Type | Covered |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Names | Person | ✅ |
| 2 | Geographic subdivisions (smaller than state) | Address | ✅ |
| 3 | Dates (except year) related to individual | Date of Birth | ✅ |
| 4 | Phone numbers | Phone Number | ✅ |
| 5 | Fax numbers | Phone Number | ✅ |
| 6 | Email addresses | Email Address | ✅ |
| 7 | Social Security Numbers | Social Security Number | ✅ |
| 8 | Medical Record Numbers | Medical Record Number | ✅ |
| 9 | Health plan beneficiary numbers | Health Insurance ID Number | ✅ |
| 10 | Account numbers | Bank Account Number | ✅ |
| 11 | Certificate/license numbers | License Number | ✅ |
| 12 | Vehicle identifiers | Vehicle ID | ✅ |
| 13 | Device identifiers | Device ID | ✅ |
| 14 | Web URLs | URL | ✅ |
| 15 | IP addresses | IP Address | ✅ |
| 16 | Biometric identifiers | Biometric Data | ✅ |
| 17 | Full-face photographs | — | N/A (text-only API) |
| 18 | Any other unique identifying number | Custom entities | ✅ |

## How Blindfold Helps

### Minimum Necessary Rule

HIPAA requires that only the **minimum necessary** PHI is used for any given purpose. With Blindfold:

```
Patient Data                     Blindfold US Region              AI Provider
"Patient Sarah Johnson,          "<Person_1>,                     AI sees only
 SSN 123-45-6789,         →      <Social Security Number_1>,  →  anonymized tokens
 MRN P-4532..."                   <Medical Record Number_1>..."

                                                                      ↓

"Patient Sarah Johnson    ←     Detokenize with mapping    ←    "Patient <Person_1>
 is a 47-year-old..."           (PHI stays in US)                is a 47-year-old..."
```

### Safe Harbor De-Identification

Blindfold's tokenization satisfies the Safe Harbor method by removing all 18 identifier types. The tokenized output is considered **de-identified data** under HIPAA, which is no longer subject to the Privacy Rule.

## US Region + `hipaa_us` Policy

### Region Selection

Use the US region to ensure PHI is processed on US-based servers:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from blindfold import Blindfold

client = Blindfold(
    api_key="your-api-key",
    region="us",  # PHI processed in the US
)
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { Blindfold } from '@blindfold/sdk';

const client = new Blindfold({
  apiKey: 'your-api-key',
  region: 'us',  // PHI processed in the US
});
```
</CodeGroup>

### What `hipaa_us` Detects

| Entity Type | Examples |
|---|---|
| Person | Sarah Johnson, Dr. Emily Chen |
| Social Security Number | 123-45-6789 |
| Medical Record Number | P-4532, MRN-78901 |
| Health Insurance ID Number | BC-9876543 |
| Date of Birth | 03/15/1978 |
| Email Address | sarah.johnson@email.com |
| Phone Number | (555) 234-5678 |
| Address | 123 Oak Street, Springfield |
| Medical Condition | chest pain, diabetes, hypertension |
| Medication | metformin, lisinopril |
| Insurance Company | BlueCross, Aetna |

## Code Examples

### Tokenize a Patient Record

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from blindfold import Blindfold
from openai import OpenAI

blindfold = Blindfold(api_key="your-key", region="us")
openai_client = OpenAI(api_key="your-openai-key")

patient_message = (
    "Patient Sarah Johnson (DOB 03/15/1978, SSN 123-45-6789, "
    "MRN P-4532) presented with chest pain. "
    "Contact: sarah.johnson@email.com, phone (555) 234-5678."
)

# Step 1: Tokenize PHI
tokenized = blindfold.tokenize(patient_message, policy="hipaa_us")

print(f"PHI detected: {tokenized.entities_count} identifiers")
for entity in tokenized.detected_entities:
    print(f"  [{entity.type}] {entity.text}")

# Step 2: Send to OpenAI — only anonymized tokens
completion = openai_client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a healthcare records assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": tokenized.text},
    ],
)

# Step 3: Restore PHI in the response
restored = blindfold.detokenize(
    completion.choices[0].message.content,
    tokenized.mapping,
)
print(restored.text)
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { Blindfold } from '@blindfold/sdk';
import OpenAI from 'openai';

const blindfold = new Blindfold({ apiKey: 'your-key', region: 'us' });
const openai = new OpenAI({ apiKey: 'your-openai-key' });

const patientMessage =
  'Patient Sarah Johnson (DOB 03/15/1978, SSN 123-45-6789, ' +
  'MRN P-4532) presented with chest pain. ' +
  'Contact: sarah.johnson@email.com, phone (555) 234-5678.';

// Step 1: Tokenize PHI
const tokenized = await blindfold.tokenize(patientMessage, {
  policy: 'hipaa_us',
});

// Step 2: Send to OpenAI
const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: 'gpt-4o-mini',
  messages: [
    { role: 'system', content: 'You are a healthcare records assistant.' },
    { role: 'user', content: tokenized.text },
  ],
});

// Step 3: Restore PHI
const restored = await blindfold.detokenize(
  completion.choices[0].message.content,
  tokenized.mapping,
);
console.log(restored.text);
```
</CodeGroup>

### Multi-Turn PHI-Safe Conversation

Maintain PHI mappings across a multi-turn healthcare chat:

```python
class HealthcareChatbot:
    def __init__(self):
        self.blindfold = Blindfold(api_key="your-key", region="us")
        self.openai = OpenAI(api_key="your-openai-key")
        self.conversation = [
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are a healthcare assistant."}
        ]
        self.mapping = {}  # Accumulated across turns

    def chat(self, user_message: str) -> str:
        # Tokenize new message
        tokenized = self.blindfold.tokenize(user_message, policy="hipaa_us")

        # Merge new mappings into conversation-wide mapping
        self.mapping.update(tokenized.mapping)

        # Add tokenized message to conversation
        self.conversation.append({"role": "user", "content": tokenized.text})

        # Send to AI — only tokens
        completion = self.openai.chat.completions.create(
            model="gpt-4o-mini",
            messages=self.conversation,
        )
        ai_response = completion.choices[0].message.content
        self.conversation.append({"role": "assistant", "content": ai_response})

        # Restore PHI for display
        restored = self.blindfold.detokenize(ai_response, self.mapping)
        return restored.text
```

### Batch PHI Redaction

Permanently remove PHI from multiple records for safe storage or logging:

```python
records = [
    "Patient: Robert Lee, SSN 111-22-3333, admitted for knee surgery.",
    "Patient: Maria Santos, DOB 11/05/1990, MRN P-2468. Allergy to penicillin.",
    "Patient: David Kim, SSN 444-55-6666, referred by Dr. Amanda Torres.",
]

# Redact all records in one call (irreversible)
batch = blindfold.redact_batch(records, policy="hipaa_us")

for i, result in enumerate(batch.results):
    print(f"Record {i+1}: {result['text']}")
    print(f"  PHI removed: {result['entities_count']} identifiers")
```

## Three Modes of PHI Protection

| Mode | Method | Reversible | Use Case |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Tokenize** | `blindfold.tokenize()` | Yes | AI chat, summarization — restore PHI in responses |
| **Redact** | `blindfold.redact()` | No | Logs, storage — permanently remove PHI |
| **Encrypt** | `blindfold.encrypt()` | Yes (with key) | Secure archives — AES-256 encrypted PHI storage |

<CodeGroup>
```python Tokenize (for AI)
# Reversible — PHI can be restored
tokenized = blindfold.tokenize(text, policy="hipaa_us")
# → "Patient <Person_1> (SSN <Social Security Number_1>)"
restored = blindfold.detokenize(response, tokenized.mapping)
```

```python Redact (for logs)
# Permanent removal — PHI cannot be recovered
redacted = blindfold.redact(text, policy="hipaa_us")
# → "Patient [REDACTED] (SSN [REDACTED])"
```

```python Encrypt (for storage)
# Reversible with encryption key
encrypted = blindfold.encrypt(text, encryption_key="your-key")
# → "Patient aGVsbG8... (SSN dGVzdA...)"
decrypted = blindfold.decrypt(encrypted.text, encryption_key="your-key")
```
</CodeGroup>

## Audit Trail

Every Blindfold API call is logged, supporting HIPAA's audit requirements (45 CFR § 164.312(b)):

- **Who**: Which API key made the request
- **What**: Entity types detected and count
- **When**: Timestamp of every PHI operation
- **Where**: Processing region (US)
- **How**: Which privacy method and policy was used

Export audit logs from the [Blindfold Dashboard](https://app.blindfold.dev).

## BAA Readiness

Blindfold is ready to sign a **Business Associate Agreement** (BAA) with covered entities and their business associates. A BAA is required under HIPAA when a third party handles PHI.

Contact us at **hello@blindfold.dev** to request a BAA.

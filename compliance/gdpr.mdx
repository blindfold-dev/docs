description: "How to process EU personal data through AI models while staying GDPR-compliant"
---

The **General Data Protection Regulation** (GDPR) applies to all EU/EEA residents' data, regardless of where your company is located. When you send personal data to AI providers like OpenAI or Anthropic, you're transferring it to a third-party processor — often outside the EU.

Blindfold solves this by **tokenizing personal data in the EU region** before it reaches any AI provider. The LLM only sees anonymized tokens like `<Person_1>` — never real names, emails, or addresses.

## Key GDPR Requirements for AI Applications

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Data Minimization (Article 5(1)(c))" icon="compress">
    **Requirement**: Only process the minimum personal data necessary for the purpose.

    **Risk with AI**: Sending full user messages to an LLM means the AI provider processes _all_ personal data in the text — far more than necessary.

    **With Blindfold**: PII is replaced with tokens before the AI call. The LLM only receives what it needs to generate a useful response, without real personal data.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Purpose Limitation (Article 5(1)(b))" icon="bullseye">
    **Requirement**: Data collected for one purpose must not be used for another.

    **Risk with AI**: AI providers may log, train on, or analyze the personal data you send them.

    **With Blindfold**: Since only tokens reach the AI provider, there's no real personal data to repurpose.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Cross-Border Transfers (Articles 44-49)" icon="plane">
    **Requirement**: Personal data transfers outside the EU/EEA require adequate safeguards (Schrems II ruling).

    **Risk with AI**: Most LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic) process data in the US, triggering Chapter V transfer rules.

    **With Blindfold**: Use the EU region (`region="eu"`) — PII is tokenized on EU servers. Only anonymized tokens cross borders, which are no longer personal data under GDPR.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Right to be Forgotten (Article 17)" icon="trash">
    **Requirement**: Data subjects can request deletion of their personal data.

    **Risk with AI**: Data sent to AI providers may be retained in their logs and training data — deletion is impossible.

    **With Blindfold**: No real personal data reaches the AI provider. For your own records, use `redact()` to permanently remove PII.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Data Processing Agreements (Article 28)" icon="file-contract">
    **Requirement**: Formal agreements must exist between data controllers and processors.

    **With Blindfold**: Since tokenized data is no longer personal data, your DPA requirements with AI providers are simplified. Blindfold offers its own DPA — contact hello@blindfold.dev.

## How Blindfold Maps to GDPR

| GDPR Article | Requirement | Blindfold Feature |
|---|---|---|
| Art. 5(1)(c) | Data minimization | Tokenization removes PII before AI calls |
| Art. 5(1)(b) | Purpose limitation | AI provider never receives real data |
| Art. 17 | Right to erasure | `redact()` permanently removes PII |
| Art. 25 | Data protection by design | SDK-level PII protection in your pipeline |
| Art. 30 | Records of processing | Audit logs track all PII operations |
| Art. 32 | Security of processing | `encrypt()` with AES-256 for storage |
| Art. 44-49 | Cross-border transfers | EU region ensures PII stays in Europe |

## EU Region + `gdpr_eu` Policy

### Region Selection

Use the EU region to ensure personal data is processed on EU-based servers:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from blindfold import Blindfold

client = Blindfold(
    api_key="your-api-key",
    region="eu",  # PII processed in the EU
)
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { Blindfold } from '@blindfold/sdk';

const client = new Blindfold({
  apiKey: 'your-api-key',
  region: 'eu',  // PII processed in the EU
});
```
</CodeGroup>

### What `gdpr_eu` Detects

The `gdpr_eu` policy covers all GDPR Article 4(1) personal data types:

| Entity Type | Examples |
|---|---|
| Person | Hans Mueller, Marie Dupont |
| Email Address | hans.mueller@example.de |
| Phone Number | +49 170 1234567 |
| Address | Berliner Str. 42, 10115 Berlin |
| IBAN | DE89 3704 0044 0532 0130 00 |
| National ID Number | Country-specific national IDs |
| Passport Number | C01X00T47 |
| Tax ID | Country-specific tax identifiers |
| Date of Birth | 15/03/1985 |
| Credit Card Number | 4532-7562-9102-3456 |
| Bank Account Number | Account numbers |
| IP Address | 192.168.1.100 |
| Health Insurance Number | Insurance identifiers |
| Medical Condition | Diagnoses, symptoms |

## Code Examples

### Tokenize Before Sending to OpenAI

The most common pattern: protect EU user data before any AI API call.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from blindfold import Blindfold
from openai import OpenAI

blindfold = Blindfold(api_key="your-key", region="eu")
openai = OpenAI(api_key="your-openai-key")

user_message = (
    "Hi, my name is Hans Mueller and I need help with my subscription. "
    "My email is hans.mueller@example.de, IBAN DE89 3704 0044 0532 0130 00."
)

# Step 1: Tokenize PII in the EU
tokenized = blindfold.tokenize(user_message, policy="gdpr_eu")
# → "Hi, my name is <Person_1> and I need help with my subscription.
#    My email is <Email Address_1>, IBAN <IBAN_1>."

# Step 2: Send only tokens to OpenAI
completion = openai.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": tokenized.text}],
)
ai_response = completion.choices[0].message.content

# Step 3: Restore real values in the response
restored = blindfold.detokenize(ai_response, tokenized.mapping)
print(restored.text)
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { Blindfold } from '@blindfold/sdk';
import OpenAI from 'openai';

const blindfold = new Blindfold({ apiKey: 'your-key', region: 'eu' });
const openai = new OpenAI({ apiKey: 'your-openai-key' });

const userMessage =
  'Hi, my name is Hans Mueller. My email is hans.mueller@example.de, ' +
  'IBAN DE89 3704 0044 0532 0130 00.';

// Step 1: Tokenize PII in the EU
const tokenized = await blindfold.tokenize(userMessage, { policy: 'gdpr_eu' });

// Step 2: Send only tokens to OpenAI
const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: 'gpt-4o-mini',
  messages: [{ role: 'user', content: tokenized.text }],
});
const aiResponse = completion.choices[0].message.content;

// Step 3: Restore real values
const restored = await blindfold.detokenize(aiResponse, tokenized.mapping);
console.log(restored.text);
```
</CodeGroup>

### Right to be Forgotten (Article 17)

When a data subject requests deletion, use `redact()` to permanently remove their PII:

```python
# User requests data deletion under GDPR Art. 17
user_records = fetch_user_records(user_id)

for record in user_records:
    redacted = blindfold.redact(record.content, policy="gdpr_eu")
    update_record(record.id, redacted.text)
    # "Hans Mueller emailed about billing"
    # → "[REDACTED] emailed about billing"

# PII permanently removed — compliant with Right to be Forgotten
```

### Batch Processing Support Tickets

Process multiple EU support tickets in a single API call:

```python
tickets = [
    "Customer Marie Dupont (marie.dupont@example.fr) reports billing issue.",
    "Jan Novak (jan.novak@example.cz) requests data export under GDPR Art. 15.",
    "Sofia Garcia, sofia.garcia@example.es, cannot access her account.",
]

# Tokenize all tickets at once
batch = blindfold.tokenize_batch(tickets, policy="gdpr_eu")

for i, result in enumerate(batch.results):
    print(f"Ticket {i+1}: {result['text']}")
    print(f"  PII removed: {result['entities_count']} entities")
```

## Data Residency

When you use `region="eu"`:

- **Processing**: PII detection runs on EU-based servers at `eu-api.blindfold.dev`
- **No cross-border transfer**: Personal data never leaves the EU during processing
- **Tokens are not personal data**: The anonymized output (`<Person_1>`) can safely cross borders
- **Your API key works globally**: No separate keys needed per region

See [Regions](/essentials/regions) for full details on data residency.

## Audit Trail for DPAs

Every Blindfold API call is logged in your audit trail, providing documentation for Data Processing Agreements:

- **What was detected**: Entity types and counts per request
- **When**: Timestamp of every PII operation
- **Which policy**: The detection policy used
- **Processing region**: EU or US

Export audit logs from the [Blindfold Dashboard](https://app.blindfold.dev) for DPA compliance reviews.

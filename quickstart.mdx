Get your first API call working in minutes. Follow these three simple steps to start protecting sensitive data.

## Step 1: Create an Account

Sign up for a Blindfold account to get started.

<Card title="Create Account" icon="user-plus" href="https://app.blindfold.dev" horizontal>
  Create your free account at app.blindfold.dev
</Card>

After signing up, you will be automatically logged into the dashboard.

## Step 2: Generate an API Key

Once logged in, navigate to the API Keys section to create your first API key.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to API Keys">
    In the dashboard, click on **API Keys** in the sidebar navigation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create New Key">
    Click the **Create API Key** button.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Name Your Key">
    Give your API key a descriptive name (e.g., "Development", "Production App").
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy Your Key">
    Copy the generated API key and store it securely. You will not be able to see it again.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Keep your API key secure and never commit it to version control. Use environment variables to store your keys.
</Warning>

## Step 3: Make Your First API Call

Choose your preferred integration method and make your first request.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Python">
    Install the Python SDK and tokenize your first text.

    ```bash
    pip install blindfold-sdk
    ```

    ```python
    from blindfold import Blindfold

    # Initialize the client
    client = Blindfold(api_key="your-api-key-here")

    # Tokenize text with sensitive data
    response = client.tokenize(
        "My email is john@example.com and phone is +1-555-1234"
    )

    print(response.text)
    # Output: "My email is <EMAIL_ADDRESS_1> and phone is <PHONE_NUMBER_1>"

    print(response.mapping)
    # Output: {'<EMAIL_ADDRESS_1>': 'john@example.com', '<PHONE_NUMBER_1>': '+1-555-1234'}
    ```

    <Tip>
      The SDK automatically handles API authentication and request formatting.
    </Tip>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="JavaScript">
    Install the JavaScript SDK and tokenize your first text.

    ```bash
    npm install @blindfold/sdk
    ```

    ```javascript
    import { Blindfold } from '@blindfold/sdk';

    // Initialize the client
    const client = new Blindfold({
      apiKey: 'your-api-key-here'
    });

    // Tokenize text with sensitive data
    const response = await client.tokenize(
      "My email is john@example.com and phone is +1-555-1234"
    );

    console.log(response.text);
    // Output: "My email is <EMAIL_ADDRESS_1> and phone is <PHONE_NUMBER_1>"

    console.log(response.mapping);
    // Output: {'<EMAIL_ADDRESS_1>': 'john@example.com', '<PHONE_NUMBER_1>': '+1-555-1234'}
    ```

    <Tip>
      The SDK works in both Node.js and browser environments.
    </Tip>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="cURL">
    Make a direct API call using cURL or any HTTP client.

    ```bash
    curl -X POST https://api.blindfold.dev/api/public/v1/tokenize \
      -H "X-API-Key: your-api-key-here" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "text": "My email is john@example.com and phone is +1-555-1234"
      }'
    ```

    **Response:**
    ```json
    {
      "text": "My email is <EMAIL_ADDRESS_1> and phone is <PHONE_NUMBER_1>",
      "mapping": {
        "<EMAIL_ADDRESS_1>": "john@example.com",
        "<PHONE_NUMBER_1>": "+1-555-1234"
      },
      "entities_count": 2,
      "detected_entities": [
        {
          "entity_type": "EMAIL_ADDRESS",
          "text": "john@example.com",
          "start": 12,
          "end": 28,
          "score": 1.0
        },
        {
          "entity_type": "PHONE_NUMBER",
          "text": "+1-555-1234",
          "start": 42,
          "end": 53,
          "score": 0.85
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

    <Tip>
      Replace `your-api-key-here` with your actual API key from Step 2.
    </Tip>
